                        Currently in my final year at EMSI Marrakesh, where I have been diligently expanding my
                        expertise in software development. I hold a Master's degree in Materials Science and have
                        successfully transitioned into the field of Software Development, with valuable experience and
                        newfound skills.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        In addition to my studies, I am also working as the Education Manager at the CPGE IbnGhazi
                        center,
                        where I oversee various educational programs and initiatives. Additionally, I serve as a Python
                        tutor at the same center,
                        where I contribute to fostering a strong understanding of programming concepts among the
                        students. In these roles,
                        I have the opportunity to apply my leadership skills and contribute to the growth and success of
                        the center,
                        nurturing an environment that promotes learning and development
